# sentiment-analysis

Author: Sreram K (sreramk26@gmail.com). All the code in the repository other than the ones in the folder third_party were written by Sreram K. 

## Notebooks:
1. Training from newly initialized weights (randomly initialized) : https://github.com/sreramk1/sentiment-analysis/blob/main/training_notebooks/train_sentiment_p1v1.ipynb
2. Iniitalizing the training with existing weights (read from the json file) : https://github.com/sreramk1/sentiment-analysis/blob/main/training_notebooks/train_sentiment_from_existing_weights_p2v1.ipynb

Please visit those notebooks, and get started immediately with Google Colab. No explicit setting-up is needed to execute those above given notebooks (as long as you execute each cell one after the other). The training API I had written (which I had now shared under Apache License), simplifies the training workflow greatly. It takes not more than 10 seconds to get started.
